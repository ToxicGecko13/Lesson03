        <h2>Picking Your Steel</h2>
        <p>You first want to begin with picking the right steel. There are many kinds, and you want to do extensive
            research to find out what one is best for you. Here are a few examples of different steels, S30V is
            superior at holding an edge, but it’s hard to sharpen, 420HC holds an okay edge, but it’s easier to
            sharpen, and 420J2 is nice to work with at the forge. There are MANY more, that’s just a few. So do your
            research on what steel will work best for what you want it to do.

        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Designing Your Knife</h2>
        <p>There are tons of different types of knives. You can do one of the many specific types, a few of which are a
            bowie, machete, or dagger. You could also mix a few different types of knives, or design your own. But
            whatever you do, make a blueprint of your knife, and make sure the drawing is the same size as what you
            want your knife to be.

        </P>
        <br>
        <h2>Forging Your Knife</h2>
        <p>Once you have the steel and blueprint for your knife, you should be able to start forging. A couple of the
            important things to remember are, to not overheat the billet (a piece of metal normally in a rectangular
            shape that you forge into something) burnt steel is extremely brittle, and never hammer on cold steel, it
            can create cracks and micro fractures, which can intern result in catastrophic failures, like your blade
            braking in half well in use.

        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Heat Treatment and Tempering</h2>
        <p>A heat treat is what hardens the steel, it can be done many different ways, one of which being, heating the
            knife up intel it’s not magnetic anymore, and then quickly cooling it done by dunking it in oil (quenching)
            or one of many different substances used for quenching. This proses hardens the steel but that also makes
            it more brittle, and the type of steel can diced how hard and brittle it becomes, so again depending on
            what you are planning to use it for, you can temper it to be less hard and intern less brittle. Tempering
            is usually done by heating it to 175–350°C (347–662°F) for 2 hours, which normally results in a good
            balance between sharpness retention, how easy it is to sharpen, and toughness. So again the recipe for
            tempering will
            depend on what you’re using the knife for.

        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Making Your Handle</h2>
        <p>Picking the right handle material can be important, if it’s more of a pretty knife rather than a tough
            knife, then you probably want some kind of synthetic material like micarta or G10 rather than a natural
            material like wood or leather, but those can be very nice looking too, if there done right. After you
            decide on a handle material, then you can start designing it, this is very important for it to be
            comfortable, appealing, functional. Comfortable and functional should always come first though. It can
            include stuff like a guard, finger hold, pommel, and lanyard hole. So design your ideal handle, make sure
            it fits your needs, and then make it a reality. Take your time and perfect it to fit your hand like a
            custom made glove.

        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Rustic or Pretty</h2>
        <p>This can be the last step, decide if you want it to be really pretty, like a mirror finish on the steel, or
            if you want it a little rustic, like leaving some hammer marks is the steel. After you decide that, ether
            clean it up, or leave it a little messy, and then you’re finished!
